## Adding new features

If you want to contribute on the code, you can fork the project, commit your changes and make a pull request. For bigger features/changes, it's better to first [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-android/issues) and ask if this feature is needed or wanted â€“ it would be very disappointing if you add a new cool feature and your pull request will be rejected by some reasons you didn't thought about.
