This is still a beta version.

This app is originally a fork of [Nextcloud Notes for Android](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes).
It is also largely insired by [ÂµLogger for Android](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/ulogger-android).
Many thanks to their developers :heart: !

What's different from other logging apps ?

PhoneTrack Android app can manage multiple configurations (called log jobs)
and log locations at different frequencies to different destinations at the same time.

It can log to [PhoneTrack Nextcloud app](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc) with a `PhoneTrack log job`
or to any server which can receive HTTP GET or POST requests with a `custom log job`.
