# MoneyBuster for Android
Shared budget manager able to sync with [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/)

This is still a beta version.

This app is originally a fork of [PhoneTrack-Android](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-android/) which is itself a fork of
[Nextcloud Notes for Android](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes).
Many thanks to their developers :heart: !

What's different from other shared budget managers ?

You can keep your project local or make it synchronize with an IHateMoney instance.
This means you can choose where your data is going and preserve your privacy.
